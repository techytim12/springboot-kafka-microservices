# Kafka-Enabled Microservices

This repository showcases a microservices architecture with three independent services interconnected via Apache Kafka. Each microservice operates autonomously and communicates asynchronously through Kafka topics. This setup fosters scalability, resilience, and loosely coupled interactions between services.

## Technologies Used

- Apache Kafka
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Docker (optional)
- Maven(Build Tool)

## Setup Instructions

1. Install and configure Apache Kafka on your local machine or server.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install all necessary dependencies by building the maven project.

## Usage

1. Start ZooKeeper Service
2. Start Apache Kafka.
3. Run each microservice application.
4. Verify successful communication between microservices via Kafka topics by posting messages through Rest APIs
